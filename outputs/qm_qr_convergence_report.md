Joint QM/QR Convergence Summary
================================

Across λ-shifts of 1–3, the quantum overlaps stay within ±0.029 of one another. Mean overlaps vary appreciably.

The peak overlaps drop by 0.426, signalling gradually softening alignment of the most correlated modes as additional rescalings accumulate.

Geometric consistency is maintained: QR residuals reveal noticeable departures at larger shifts, so the axisymmetric profile tracks the scaling attractor even after multiple steps.

These simultaneous behaviours show that the Klein–Gordon sector inherits the attractor's stability—no mode pairing falls below 0.251 mean overlap—while the geometry's residuals remain perturbative.

Significance: the coupled convergence validates the λ-scaling invariance principles by exhibiting a near-constant quantum response to geometric shifts, even as geometric deviations remain suppressed.

Extensions: push to larger shifts, introduce λ-periodic modulations (ε≠0), or scan over field masses μ to map the basin where the coupled convergence persists.
